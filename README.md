1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/temitayss2/phishing-awareness.git
    ```

2. **Change directory to the project folder**:
    ```bash
    cd phishing-awareness
    ```

3. **Set up the virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Initialize the database**:
    ```bash
    flask db init
    flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
    flask db upgrade
    ```

6. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

To start the application, run:

```bash
python app.py
```

Once the server is running, you can access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. The admin interface is accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin`, where you can manage phishing scenarios, view reports, and configure settings.

### Simulating a Phishing Scenario

1. Log in to the admin interface.
2. Create a new phishing scenario.
3. Deploy the scenario to target users.
4. Monitor user interactions and generate awareness reports.

## Features

- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage phishing scenarios, track user activities, and generate reports.
- **Custom Scenarios**: Create and deploy custom phishing scenarios.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitor user interactions with phishing emails in real-time.
- **Reports**: Generate detailed reports on user performance and phishing awareness.

## Configuration

You can configure the application settings in `config.py`:

```python
DEBUG = True  # Set to False in production
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///database.db'  # Change to your preferred database
SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'  # Set a strong secret key for session management
```
